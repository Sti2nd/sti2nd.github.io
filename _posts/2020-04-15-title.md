## Printing correct physical size using CSS

On one personal project of mine I wanted to print a box (a HTML div) on paper with the specific dimensions 32mm x 35mm. I found that CSS actually had the property(?) mm.

Measuring my laptop screen the dimensions where off, but I thought it perhaps would solve itself when printing. It turns out, it didn't. So did I do anything wrong? What is the purpose of the CSS properties `in`, `cm` and `mm` if they don't match the units inch, centimetre nor millimetre specified by _ and the International System of Units?

I googled and came over this link https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/614 .
