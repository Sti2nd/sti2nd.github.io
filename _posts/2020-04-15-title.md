## Introduction and problem

On one personal project of mine I wanted to print a box (a HTML div) on paper with the specific dimensions 32mm x 35mm. Said again a little differently, I wanted the box on the paper to be 32mm x 35mm in our real physical world, and I wanted to use CSS to design it.

The first thing that comes to mind is that it would be nice if one could just tell CSS that the width is 32mm and the height is 35mm. Turns out, you can! CSS actually supports `mm` as a unit, so let's use it.

Measuring my laptop screen the dimensions were off, but I thought it perhaps would solve itself when printing. It turns out, it didn't. Did I do anything wrong? What is the purpose of the CSS units `in`, `cm` and `mm` if they don't match the standardization (which for centimetres and millimetres is defined by the International System of Units)?

From now on I will only write `cm` when talking about `cm`, `mm`, `in` and [the other absolute length units](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/#absolute-lengths).

## Some answers

I googled and came over an [issue on CSS' ability to display physical size](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/614) on the Github repo of CSS Working Group Editor Drafts. The thread was started by Nick Sherman who means the `cm` unit when used on a screen should be rendered in equal lenght as its physical counterpart; 1 cm on screen should match 1 cm in real life. Not exactly the same problem I had, but there is much more to learn here. I found [another text about CSS units](https://webplatform.github.io/docs/tutorials/understanding-css-units/), this time from the archived WebPlatform project, to supplement the Github thread.

Back when it was common for screens to have 96 device pixels per inch (96 dppi) the CSS `cm` was defined. At that time, printing at 96 dots per inch (96 dpi) was the exact same length as 1 inch on most screens, since they had 96 device pixels per inch. So the device pixels were equally far away from each other on the screen as the dots were on paper, with the result that 1 cm on the screen (with 96 dppi) was 1 cm on paper (with 96dpi).

Then the device pixels per inch started increasing
